## [What is computer science?](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/0/#what-is-computer-science)

-   Computer science is fundamentally problem solving, but we’ll need to be precise and methodical.
-   We can think of **problem solving** as the process of taking some input (a problem we want to solve) and generate some output (the solution to our problem).

-   To begin doing that, we’ll need a way to represent inputs and outputs, so we can store and work with information in a standardized way.
-   To represent letters, all we need to do is decide how numbers map to letters. Some humans, many years ago, collectively decided on a standard mapping of numbers to letters.
