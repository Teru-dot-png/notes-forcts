- [ ]  Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- [ ]  Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- [ ]  Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one
variable.
- [ ]  Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via **Make a Block**), which must take at least one input.
- [ ]   Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).
