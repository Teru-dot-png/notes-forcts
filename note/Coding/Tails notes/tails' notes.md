programming is problem solving

# pseudocode
formalizing code by creating a method on your head
and dividing the problem in steps
EG: 

	pick up phonebook
	open middle of phonebook
	if person is on middle
	    call person
	else if person is earlier in book 
	    open to middle left half of book
	    go back to line 3
	else if person is later in book 
	    open to middle right half of book
	    go back to line 3
	else
	    end
	
	//its not what you want ultimately but make some progress
	 //reuse your code and functions to make it more optimized

next thin on what to do is create a scrach program listed on [[todo on tails's scrach game]]
