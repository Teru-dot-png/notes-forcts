programming is problem solving

(128)(64)(32)(16)(8)(4)(2)(1) binary

# pseudocode
formalizing code by creating a method on your head
and dividing the problem in steps
EG: 

	pick up phonebook
	open middle of phonebook
	if person is on middle
	    call person
	else if person is earlier in book 
	    open to middle left half of book
	    go back to line 3
	else if person is later in book 
	    open to middle right half of book
	    go back to line 3
	else
	    end
	
	//its not what you want ultimately but make some progress
	 //reuse your code and functions to make it more optimized

next thin on what to do is create a scrach program listed on [[todo on tails's scrach game]]

i learnt that there are many ways to do wall colission
i also now know there should be many ways that one thing leaving me to many other limitations

i learnt how to do walk code and dialog stuff and interaction on a top down game
still dont rly know how to do a better dialog skip but thats fine
learnt some stuff about variables and how they function and booleans and i think i know 
how functions go on little wierd for me but theres many steps to take to learn
i even did a little terminal inside the game! i made(tails)

## Types, format codes, operators cheat sheet

-   There are many data **types** we can use for our variables, which indicate to our program what type of data they represent:
    -   `bool`, a Boolean expression of either `true` or `false`
    -   `char`, a single character like `a` or `2`
    -   `double`, a floating-point value with more digits than a `float`
    -   `float`, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
    -   `int`, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
    -   `long`, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an `int`
    -   `string`, a string of characters
    -   …
-   And the CS50 Library has corresponding functions to get input of various types:
    -   `get_char`
    -   `get_double`
    -   `get_float`
    -   `get_int`
    -   `get_long`
    -   `get_string`
    -   …
-   For `printf`, too, there are different placeholders for each type, called **format codes**:
    -   `%c` for chars
    -   `%f` for floats or doubles
    -   `%i` for ints
    -   `%li` for long integers
    -   `%s` for strings
-   There are several mathematical **operators** we can use, too:
    -   `+` for addition
    -   `-` for subtraction
    -   `*` for multiplication
    -   `/` for division
    -   `%` for remainder
