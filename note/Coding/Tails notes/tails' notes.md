programming is problem solving

pseudocode
formalizing code by creating a method on your head
and dividing the problem in steps
EG: 

	pick up phonebook
	open middle of phonebook
	if person is on middle
	    call person
	else if person is earlier in book 
    open to middle left half of book
    go back to line 3
else if person is later in book 
    open to middle right half of book
    go back to line 3
else
    end
	
	its not what you want ultimately but make some progress
	 reuse your code and functions to make it more optimized
