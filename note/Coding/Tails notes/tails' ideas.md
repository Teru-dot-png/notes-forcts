# α the begining
#β
  x1 is born its intelligence is equal to a old cat that understeands human comunications,
while this Concious dossent processes its E.e.m needs, its comparable to talking to a
half awake mind.

#Ψβ
   x1 is copied for experimental reasons, her copy so called "brother" from dr.henrique,
we got insane data from making both conscious interact, "brother" had multiple attempts to consume x1, it dossent matter how much  we reseted his memories he still went down the same path as if hes trying to asssimlate back to his origins
